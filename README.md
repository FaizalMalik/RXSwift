# RXSwift
In Progress - This is a sample mvvm app demonstrate the usage of frameworks RxSwift and RxCocca for making the swift programming language Interactive.

This example uses RxSwift observables as binding mechanism between `ViewController` and `ViewModel`.

Note: I have a plan to develope this as a boilerplate for an ecommerce application, with feature like Login/Signup, listing items, add to cart and checkout etc.

- RXSwift
